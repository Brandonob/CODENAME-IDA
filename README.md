# Tinni

Welcome to our app **Tinni**!. Our site allows users to have access to core Yelp functionalities. Users are able to search for topics or places that are in the NYC area. Reviews are displayed on each individual restaurant page along with some more relevant information. Users are then able to add those places to an Itinerary. They can customize it for a specific day, give it a name, and share it via email.Â 

Built with React.js, Node.js with Express, and PostgreSQL.
