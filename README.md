# Tinni

Thanks for checking our my app Tinni. My site allows users to have access to core Yelp functionalities. Users are able to search for topics or restaurants that are in the NYC area. You are able to sort and filter to your liking. Reviews are displayed on each individual restaurant page along with some more relevant information. Users can then leave a review once signed in.

Technologies This full-stack application app has been developed with a frontend and backend using the technologies aligned below.

Backend: For the Database, we have opted to use Postgress. We used Express and helper packages body-parser, cors. This enabled us to create get, post, and patch routes. The backend was then deployed to Heroku.



Frontend: For the frontend, We have decided to use React-Redux ToolKit. This frame wire has been set up to encompass core components with their state under each corresponding folder. For routing, we used react-router-dom that let us set up individual webpages as well as pass ids throughout the app. For user login and signup I decided to use Google's firebase that allowed for better security. We also choose to also enable users to sign up via google and facebook. Users can search using a combination of Yelp's api and Google maps api. After saving they are able to share via email! Tinni is the one website you need. Run your day, dont let your day run you!
